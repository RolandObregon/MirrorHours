# MirrorHours
## Script that sends notification when a mirror hour happens
### To understand what a mirror hour is, check [this page](https://www.mirrorhour.com/)
The functional part is the main.py, meanwhile the install.py will get the required packages and set up the main.py in your start up folder.
### What does it do?
The script will send a notification approximately 34 times in one day.Right now it uses AM/PM format so it doesn't activate on hours like 13:13. It won't activate on [reversed hours](https://www.mirrorhour.com/reversed/)
and also won't activate in some triple hours.
